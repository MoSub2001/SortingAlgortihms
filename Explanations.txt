How the algorithms work:

1- Quicksort: is a divide and conquer algorithm, what I mean by that is that instead of sorting the whole thing, lets 
sort some sort of smaller array, but before that, we need to choose how we are going to choose the smaller array.
putting that aside, lets start with a simpler concept, the pivot. The pivot is the point we sort the array around, 
simply put, anything smaller than the pivot, goes on the left of it, anything bigger , goes on the right. After we 
are done with that, we sort from the begginning untill the pivot, and from the pivot to the end. We do that for all 
smaller arrays and then we merge these sorted arrays.

2-MergeSort: also a divide and conquer algorith, but much simpler in concept, keep dividing the array by half untill 
you get to the smallest possible array, then start merging them back together in order. Same merging as quicksort.

3-bubbleSort: The simplest sorting algorithm. We go over each element, if it is larger than the next element, we swap them.

4-InsertSort: This one I think has a nice concept. Here, we start from the second element not the first. We insert each element into
its place, here is what I mean. Imagine you have an array and you are looping over it, you are now at the seventh index.
Everything below the seventh index is sorted, so as long as I know it is sorted, I need to find the largest element in
that sorted subarray that the current element is larger than, and the next element it is smaller than and "insert" 
the element there.

for example:

arr= [1,5,6,7,3,9,11] and you are at index 4, the element 3. Everything below that is sorted. you are trying to find
the largest element that 3 is larger than, and the smallest element that 3 is smaller than and insert it there.
